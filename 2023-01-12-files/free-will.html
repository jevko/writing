<h1>The Free Will Wager</h1>

<p>The existence of free will is debatable and it is likely impossible to definitely find out whether it exists or not.</p>

<p>However, it seems like an answer to this question is rather desirable and important for most people. Believing one way or the other certainly has the potential to significantly alter one's interaction with the world.</p>

<p>Therefore, one might seek a way to decide for oneself whether one believes in the existence of free will or not. The question indeed appears impossible to answer objectively, but perhaps there is a heuristic that can help.</p>

<p>In thinking about this, I stumbled upon one such heuristic, which upon closer inspection appears to be analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">Pascal's Wager</a>.</p>

<p>I shall call it The Free Will Wager. It is summarized by the following table:</p>

<style>
  body {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
  }
  td {
    padding: 0.5rem;
    text-align: center;
  }
  .green {
    border-left: 10px solid green;
    color: red;
  }
  table {
    border: none;
  }
</style>
<table cellspacing="0">
  <caption>does free will exist?</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <div style="text-align: right;padding-left:4rem">your bet&nbsp;</div><br />
        <div style="text-align: left;">reality</div>
      </th>
      <th style="vertical-align:top; border: 1px solid green; border-bottom: none;">yes</th>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th style="vertical-align:top; border: 1px solid red; border-bottom: none;">no</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">yes</th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(0,128,0); border: 1px solid green; border-bottom: none; border-top: none">right<br />by choice</td>
      <th></th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(64,0,0); border: 1px solid red; border-top: none; border-bottom: none;">wrong<br />by choice</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">no</th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(64,64,0); border: 1px solid green; border-top: none">wrong<br />no choice</td>
      <th></th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(0,64,0); border: 1px solid red; border-top: none;">right<br />no choice</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>If you bet that free will does exist, in the worst case you are wrong, but have no choice -- which I assume to be better than being wrong while having a choice; in the best case you are right and you are choosing correctly -- which I assume to be better than being right without real say in the matter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you bet that free will does not exist, in the worst case you are wrong, and failing to act upon your free will; in the best case you are right, but not by choice.</p>

<p>By this analysis it makes more sense to bet that free will does indeed exist and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Hence, one should pick the first column in the table (outlined in green) rather than the second column (outlined in red).</p>

<h2>Aside</h2>

<p>I was not the first person to come up with this wager -- it is described on the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Free_will#The_free_will_wager">Rational Wiki</a>, even under the same name.</p>

<p>I found this out after I worked out and wrote all of the above. I remember and even have written down my thought processes that led me to figuring this out. It took some time and back-and-forth. I remember the moment it clicked and I felt like having reduced this existential issue to this simple Pascal's Wager-like (I was familiar with Pascal's Wager then) scheme was an important result for me. It  gave me feelings of comfort, clarity, understanding at the time.</p>

<p>Now it's not impossible that I would read about it in the Wiki some years prior, forget about it, and then my figuring out would actually be recalling without knowing about it. Mind walking an old very faded path, that nonetheless was still a bit there and easier to walk than an entirely new path.</p>

<p>However it certainly didn't feel like it and it's at least as equally plausible to me (and it does feel like it) that I just figured out the same thing that somebody else figured out before me, having similar tools, knowledge, and background.</p>

<p>This is not the first time I see such convergence not just in myself, but elsewhere. It's a very-small scale example of an apparent general phenomenon whose large-scale manifestation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">multiple discovery</a>. Another manifestation of this phenomenon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution">convergent evolution</a>.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, all this seems to me to cast a vote against free will. One thinks and feels as if one is figuring out or finding out something novel, which certainly seems to involve a lot of exercise of free will, while in reality one is almost being pushed onto predetermined grooves.</p>

<p>Nothing truly novel is generated or invented -- it's just discovered. This in turn points to the probable existence of some objective reality or truth that may be gradually revealing itself or growing in the universe. Anyway we quickly get into some pretty weird philosophical/metaphysical stuff.</p>

<p>But going back on topic.</p>

<h2>Polemic</h2>

<p>So on the face of it, the free will wager seems sensible. But, there is quite a bit of assumptions there. [...]</p>

<p>If one believes free will does exist, but fails to exercise it (as factors that work against it are also in play), one might feel bad, guilty, etc.</p>

<p>If one believes otherwise, then such feelings are no longer sensible.</p>

<p>When it feels like you're given a choice -- then what should you do?</p>

<p>When it feels like you aren't -- then there is no question.</p>

<h2>Finally?</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most honest and useful answer to the question "does free will exist?" is "I don't know". Perhaps it's the only answer. I don't know and most likely I will never know.</p>

<p>Sometimes it feels more like free will exists in some form, sometimes it feels like it doesn't.</p>

<p>So just observe and act to the best of your ability without judging one way or the other.</p>
