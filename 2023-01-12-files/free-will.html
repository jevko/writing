<h1>The Free Will Wager</h1>

<p>The existence of free will is debatable and it is likely impossible to definitely find out whether it exists or not.</p>

<p>However, it seems like an answer to this question is rather desirable and important for most people. Believing one way or the other certainly has the potential to significantly alter one's interaction with the world.</p>

<p>Therefore, one might seek a way to decide for oneself whether one believes in the existence of free will or not. The question indeed appears impossible to answer objectively, but perhaps there is heuristic that can help.</p>

<p>In thinking about this, I stumbled upon one such heuristic, which upon closer inspection appears to be analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">Pascal's Wager</a>.</p>

<p>I shall call it The Free Will Wager. It is summarized by the following table:</p>

<style>
  body {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
  }
  td {
    padding: 0.5rem;
    text-align: center;
  }
  .green {
    border-left: 10px solid green;
    color: red;
  }
  table {
    border: none;
  }
</style>
<table cellspacing="0">
  <caption>does free will exist?</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <div style="text-align: right;padding-left:4rem">your bet&nbsp;</div><br />
        <div style="text-align: left;">reality</div>
      </th>
      <th style="vertical-align:top; border: 1px solid green; border-bottom: none;">yes</th>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th style="vertical-align:top; border: 1px solid red; border-bottom: none;">no</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">yes</th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(0,128,0); border: 1px solid green; border-bottom: none; border-top: none">right<br />by choice</td>
      <th></th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(64,0,0); border: 1px solid red; border-top: none; border-bottom: none;">wrong<br />by choice</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">no</th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(64,64,0); border: 1px solid green; border-top: none">wrong<br />no choice</td>
      <th></th>
      <td style="background-color: rgb(0,64,0); border: 1px solid red; border-top: none;">right<br />no choice</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>if you bet that free will does exist, in the worst case you are wrong, but have no choice -- which I assume to be better than being wrong while having a choice; in the best case you are right and you are choosing correctly -- which I assume to be better than being right without real say in the matter</p>

<p>on the other hand, if you bet that free will does not exist, in the worst case you are wrong, and failing to act upon your free will; in the best case you are right, but not by choice</p>

<p>by this analysis it makes more sense to bet that free will does indeed exist and act accordingly.</p>
