# Opinion: the good the bad of generative artificial intelligence

LLMs are great for things like translating, summarizing, padding drafts.

Generative AI for images, video, and potentially other modalities can have similar applications.

Used well, these AIs can be very good tools that speed up and support work.

If used incorrectly, they can be very nasty tools that accelerate and further the disintegration of society.

Since a lot of data generated by people was used to create them, not always respecting the will of those people, making these tools available to people in an open way seems only right.

It would also be a good idea to teach people how to use these tools or at least how they work. And it would be nice to do it in a way that would benefit everyone -- both employees and employers.

Hyping it up with exaggerated marketing, using it for nefarious purposes, focusing on extracting value at the expense of most people is the wrong way.
