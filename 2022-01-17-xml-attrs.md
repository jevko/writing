# Semantics of XML attributes

In this article we are going to look at the semantics of XML attributes.

They can be conveyed as 3 Us: Unique, Unordered, Unstructured.

Let's look at each semantic in detail.

## Unique

There can be only one attribute with a given name in an XML element.

For example this is correct:

```xml
<a href="#1">link</a>
```

while this is not:

```xml
<a href="#1" href="#2">link</a>
```

## Unordered

The order in which attributes appear in an element does not matter.

For example these elements are equivalent:

```xml
<a href="#" id="link1">link</a>
<a id="link1" href="#">link</a>
```

## Unstructured

The value of an attribute can only be text. It cannot contain nested XML elements or attributes.

For example even though the value of the `id` attribute in the following element contains XML syntax, it will not be parsed as such:

```xml
<a href="#" id="<source>1</source><value>link1</value>">link</a>
```

similarly there is no notion of nested attributes in XML:

```xml
<a href="#" id="source='1' value='link1'">link</a>
```
