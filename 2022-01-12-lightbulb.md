# How many data types does it take to change a lightbulb?

What do [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), and [TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) have in common?

All are human-readable formats which can encode complex data of various types (that might be arguable in the case of CSV and INI, but let's give them a pass for the sake of this argument).

Suppose we were to design [a new format](https://jevko.org), [for whatever reason](https://xkcd.com/927/). How many data types should it support? How many data types *does* a format support?

To help answer this philosophical question let's see what the short answer is for each of the above.

## How many data types does CSV support?

The first rule of CSV is: you do not talk about data types.

## How many data types does INI support?

THE FIRST RULE OF INI IS: YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT DATA TYPES!

## How many data types does XML support?

It's not that simple, okay?

## How many data types does JSON support?

About six. Six or seven.

## How many data types does YAML support?

At least as many as JSON!

## How many data types does TOML support?

Almost as many as JSON plus a few more!

## Conclusion

Hm, looks like there is no short answer. Let's sleep on it and try again tomorrow.
