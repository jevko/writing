# Draft: Little green squares

Great way to motivate oneself and keep it up. Apply the Seinfeld method. Very nice for that. But, alas, just like everything these have a nasty underside. These particular GitHub ones.

The problem is that it is not you who is crossing these off, but the machine. The machine has its own criteria for what counts. These are sometimes sensible. But other times they are not. Fulfilling them only for the machine to give you your daily hit of the green stuff really becomes... well, harmful. It creates new problems. Nothing is solved.

No, maybe something is solved. But in a twisted way. And you get issues you haven't even imagined before. Now time is wasted doing new kinds of useless things. Semi-useful. However you want to put it. There's always something, I tell you!

Nothing can really substitute a properly working mind. It always comes down to that. It's the mind that keeps up. Or doesn't keep up. And by "substitute" I mean "replace". But it's okay to make this sort of mistakes when thinking. Sometimes one thinks by pressing buttons on a weird electronic device.

Perhaps we lost ourselves in this symbiosis with machines. We are not balanced. Well, in the grand scheme of things things may always be balanced, just fluctuating. In the not-so-grand scheme we have went a bit off the rails in a few important dimensions. Ones where balance is important for our survival. Then again, our collective survival may be unimportant in the grand scheme of things.

Alright, I've gone too far with this. From little green squares to collective survival. Welcome to the jungle of this mind.
