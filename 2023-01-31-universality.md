# Dichotomy of universality

One way to have a universal syntax is to cover all possible use cases and make it extremely rich -- this is, ultimately, not possible to fully realize.

Another way is to be generic enough to be able to accomodate any syntactical feature -- this is the way of Jevko.

Annotated trees are the most generic syntactical structure. Jevko is a syntax for that.
