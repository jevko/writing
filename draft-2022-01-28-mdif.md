# Draft: A Minimal Data Interchange Format

The concept of [electronic data interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange) was concieved in the early days of computer networking.

As technology advanced, a need for a universal human-readable format to facilitate ubiquitous data interchange was slowly arising.

The accelerating growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web turned this need into a pressing matter.

XML, "originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing", was repurposed to address the issue.

Because XML was not purpose-built, it was not an optimal solution.

Thus, at the turn of the millenium, JSON emerged as a more minimal and suitable solution, successfully reducing the accidental complexity of XML.

In the last decade JSON rose to domination in the domain of data interchange, [displacing XML](2022-01-09-xml-json-trends.md).
