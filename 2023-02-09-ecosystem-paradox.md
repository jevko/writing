# The Ecosystem Paradox

[An article "Languages are not Ecosystems" by Fernando Borretti](https://borretti.me/article/languages-not-ecosystems) which I found [on Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/5qofsf/languages_are_not_ecosystems) prompted me to formulate my thoughts on a very related matter into what I shall call *The Ecosystem Paradox* -- an informal software law/conjecture which can be stated as:
