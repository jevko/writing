# Truth and simplicity go together

It seems plausible, albeit not quite provable, that the simplest things are the closest to the truth.

A fairly reliable heuristic for going in the direction of truth is something like the [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor): faced with several explanations for something, select the simplest one. It is the most likely to be (approximately) true and it will be the best one to work with further. It shall also lend itself the most to deep understanding in the long run.

In a similar manner, simplest solutions are best. Solving a problem and finding out the truth are alike. There may be many paths to get there, but the least distracting ones will most likely get you there, with space remaining to absorb more.
