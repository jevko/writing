# Paradox might be fundamental

It seems that digging deep enough into some area of thought, the shovel of one's mind eventually hits a contradiction.

Typically, we are uncomfortable with those contradictions and paradoxes and we try to resolve them, hoping that this way we will reach a better, even deeper, understanding. And maybe we will.

But also, perhaps, we shall never get rid of contradiction entirely. Perhaps it's fundamental. Perhaps it's the engine of reality itself, the bedrock. The world stems from the fact that it exists, things happen because there can never be a final resolution.

The existence of contradiction might be timeless, basic.

The logical principle of explosion ("from a contradiction, anything follows") then should not be interpreted as pointing out a fundamental error, but stating a fundamental fact. It *is* the free miracle we need to complete our theories of everything.
