# Draft: Explicit decoding of syntax trees into specific types

Jevko is pure syntax separated from semantics.

This separation of concerns allows for fine-grained control over how individual parts of a syntax tree are interpreted.

One way to realize this control is to explicitly extract different parts of a Jevko syntax tree as specific types.
