# One Syntax To Rule All

What if we had a minimal syntax that could glue together any number of other syntaxes and formats?

Where you could, within a single text document, splice a bit of JSON here, a bit of XML there, maybe a little bit of INI elsewhere.

All that without needing to escape or otherwise adjust anything in these spliced fragments?

Each of these fragments being an entry in a larger structure?

Would that be useful? Could be.

Would that be cool? Hell yeah!

Well, it's about to become possible.
