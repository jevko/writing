# The BLAST programming language

BLAST is an extension of [LAST](https://xtao.org/blog/last-intro.html) that adds one crucial extra instruction:

* **B**ind which accepts a name and two expressions. The first expression is bound to the name. That expression can then be referenced in the second expression using that name.

Bind provides a convenient way for defining variables.

Recall the syntax of LAST:

```abnf
Term = "L" Term / "A" Term Term / "S" Term / "T"
```

In BLAST, this is extended to:

```abnf
Term = "B" Name Term Term / "L" Name Term / "A" Term Term / "S" Name Term / "T"
```

Where `Name` is an identifier. For now let's say we only allow lowercase ASCII alphanumeric characters and single spaces (BLAST then allows multiword identifiers with spaces!).

A `Name`s can be empty and we can get by without ever using Bind -- in that case BLAST behaves exactly like LAST -- all valid LAST programs are also valid BLAST programs and have the same meaning. In other words, BLAST is a superset of LAST.

However using `Name`s is very convenient and makes our programs much easier to handle by humans.
