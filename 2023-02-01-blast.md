# The BLAST programming language

BLAST is an extension of LAST that adds one crucial extra instruction:

* **B**ind which accepts a name and two expressions. The first expression is bound to the name. That expression can then be referenced in the second expression using that name.

Bind provides a convenient way for defining variables.

Recall the syntax of LAST:

```abnf
Term = "L" Term / "A" Term Term / "S" Term / "T"
```
