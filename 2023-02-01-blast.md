# The BLAST programming language

BLAST is an extension of LAST that adds one crucial extra instruction:

* **B**ind which accepts a name and two expressions. The first expression is bound to the name. That expression can then be referenced in the second expression using that name.

Bind provides a convenient way for defining variables.

Recall the syntax of LAST:

```abnf
Term = "L" Term / "A" Term Term / "S" Term / "T"
```

In BLAST, this is extended to:

```abnf
Term = "B" Name Term Term / "L" Name Term / "A" Term Term / "S" Name Term / "T"
```

Where `Name` is an identifier. For now let's say we only allow lowercase ASCII alphanumeric characters and single spaces (BLAST then allows multiword identifiers with spaces!).

<!-- todo: example program, ;/'[] <-> BLAST syntax sugar, note: we can "unshadow" variables to any depth, all LAST programs are valid BLAST (it's a superset) -->
