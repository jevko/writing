# Standard text-based cosmic-scale information encoding

Standard large-scale communication technologies are layered.

At the edge of hardware and software is the binary code.

On top of that, in the realm of text (i.e. what can be efficiently processed by humans), we have thus far agreed upon Unicode, and more specifically UTF-8, which is in turn compatible with ASCII.

These layers allow us to communicate strings of characters.

Now for machines to make sense of those and efficiently process them, we need something on top of that which will introduce structure to go with these strings.

That something is a simple common language or syntax capable of expressing some sort of a universal data structure.

So far the best candidate for that, that naturally goes with any kind of syntax, is a tree. Trees. Universal data structures.

The best candidates for expressing these that have been very widely adopted have been XML, later largely supreseded by JSON.

But these don't seem to achieve the satisfactory level of universality that we might be after or need.

I believe Jevko is closer to that ideal.
