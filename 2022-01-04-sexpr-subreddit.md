# r/sexpr

Announcement: I started a specialized subreddit: [r/sexpr](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexpr). Its description is:

> Technical dscussions about data formats and syntaxes like JSON, XML, YAML, S-expressions. Configuration, data-interchange, serialization. Pros and cons, interesting cases, problems, choices.

A caffeinated experiment for 2022 to take "start a subreddit" off the bucketlist, spiting the coronavirus.

Maybe another round of caffeine or serendipity will make it go forward. Maybe not.
