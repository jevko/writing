# Jevko: year three or five or n

[Jevko was introduced](https://djedr.github.io/posts/jevko-2022-02-22.html) on 2022-02-22T20:22:02, 2 years ago. 

Two years before that, on 02.02.2020 02:02:20.20, [Jevko's predecessor](http://djedr.github.io/format.html) appeared.

Four or five years before that, [the predecessor of the predecessor](https://djedr.github.io/masters_thesis.pdf) was created.

Further back still: ideas, fragments, inspirations, ingredients.

"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe" --  when did I hear that? Around 2010. Watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos instead of going to school.

Times are always crazy. We just don't always pay attention.

Let's see what the future will bring.
