# Common Business Communication Language

Long before JSON, XML, even the World Wide Web itself -- only 5 years after the epoch, [a great elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) sat to write [an ancient scroll](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/cbcl2/cbcl2.html). In it, he described the idea of the [Common Business Communication Language (CBCL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Business_Communication_Language).

Envisioned 8 years prior by [another elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran), it was to be the language that should facilitate... online shopping. Could such a thing be completely automated?

The two elders finished their journeys the same year, at the beginning of the last decade, having lived the same number of years.

Ten years prior, also the same year, after the same number of years, Father Time took [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon) [elders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) of a preceding generation.

Sometimes He likes to make it about numbers like that.

Now, of course this is all coincidental, and if we increase sharpness, the pattern disappears. Still, isn't it interesting that there are such patterns at all?

Life sometimes appears more regular than we would suppose.

Anyway, I digress.
