# Common Business Communication Language

Long before JSON, XML, even the World Wide Web itself -- only 5 years after the epoch, [a great elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) sat to write [an ancient scroll](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/cbcl2/cbcl2.html). In it, he described the idea of the [Common Business Communication Language (CBCL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Business_Communication_Language).

Envisioned 8 years prior by [another elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran), it was to be the language that should facilitate... online shopping. Could such a thing be completely automated?
