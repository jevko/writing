# Fungi get you in the end

One discernible form of you is a cell within your mother's body.

This cell combines with a cell from your father, starting a physical phenomenon, a chemical reaction, a biological development -- that has a tendency, an inclination to continue, and grow, and last, sustain a particular form that goes through predictable stages.

What starts as a body part, directly connected to and continuous with the mother's body, is separated -- providing a basis for an individual, a semi-independent biological entity, a human. To successfully develop into that, one needs a relatively long time and sustained favorable conditions.

You develop into an independent individual (if you are lucky) only to gradually start losing that and go back to a less and less capable form, ultimately relinquishing all your constituents back into the environment, to be incorporated into other forms of life.

First of these in line are various microbes -- bacteria and fungi, some of which existed in symbiosis with the autonomous system of cells of your body before it ceased functioning as a self-directed whole.
