# Countless simple low-level interactions producing immense high-level complexity

Think neurons in a nervous system: passing on electrochemical signals. From the perspective of a single neuron or a small group of them not that much is happening.

Now, bees in a beehive or ants in an anthill -- pretty much the same deal as the neurons. One ant to another -- just doing a simple job. Taken as a whole though -- it's quite a happening.

These beehives and these anthills and these people are then parts in a larger system. An ecological system.
