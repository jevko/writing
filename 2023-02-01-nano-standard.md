# Standard text-based nano-scale information encoding

What criteria would be desirable in a communication format suitable for nano-networks, i.e. between nano-devices?

Certainly, taking limited processing capabilities of such devices, the format would need to be as minimal as possible. We'd care about maximizing compactness and minimizing waste.

If we require that such format should be human-readable, what existing technology fits the bill the best?

[Here](https://jevko.github.io/compactness.html) is a look at a few contenders, focused on compactness.
